Q1: Assuming T is defined in Java, what code do I write to get "sun" back?

My Code:
// assuming that children and value are initialized
// prints “sun” value
System.out.println(T.getChildren().get(0).getChildren().get(0).getValue());

Explanation: 
T.getChildren() points to all of the children of the root node (“hat”) in tree (T)
T.getChildren().get(0) gets the 0th child in List (“lit”)
T.getChildren().get(0).getChildren().get(0) points to the 0th child in the List of the 0th child subtree (“sun”)
T.getChildren().get(0).getChildren().get(0).getValue() gets the value of the 0th child in 0th List (“sun”)
