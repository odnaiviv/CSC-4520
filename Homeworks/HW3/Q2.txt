Q2: What will System.out.println(T.getChildren().get(2).getChildren()) output? Be as specific as possible.

My Output: “pup”

Explanation: 
T.getChildren() points to all of the children of the root node (“hat”) in tree (T)
T.getChildren().get(2) gets the 2nd child in List (“cat”)
T.getChildren().get(2).getChildren() points to the child in the List of the 2nd child subtree (“pup”)
The value “pup” is then printed as the expected output.
