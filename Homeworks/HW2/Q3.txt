Q3: QuickSort

least number of recursive calls = best case scenario
best case is when pivot is in the middle

pivot = list(n-1) / 2

Array Examples: 
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]

[1, 17, 16, 2, 5, 4, 12, 13, 9, 10, 15, 7, 6, 14, 8, 3, 11, 18]


*any 18-element list will work as long as pivot is in the middle of list
