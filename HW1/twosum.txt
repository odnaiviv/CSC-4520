// I used these Lecture 2 Slides to help me write my pseudocode from the given Java code

algorithm twoSumFast
    input: arr, target
    output: sum of target value

    HashSet of Integers seen
    for each element j in arr
        otherAddend = target - each j in arr
        if seen contains otherAddend
            for each element i in arr
                if each i in arr = otherAddend
                    return [i, j] as new array
                else
                    add seen to each j in arr
            return [-1, -1] as new array
